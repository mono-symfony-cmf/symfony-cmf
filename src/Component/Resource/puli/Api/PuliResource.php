/**
 * A resource.
 *
 * Resources are objects which can be stored in a resource repository. Resources
 * have a path, under which they are stored in the repository.
 *
 * Depending on the implementation, resources may offer additional functionality:
 *
 *  * Resources that are similar to files in that they have a body and a size
 *    should implement {@link BodyResource}.
 *
 * Resources can be attached to a repository by calling {@link attachTo()}. They
 * can be detached again by calling {@link detach()}. Use {@link isAttached()}
 * to find out whether a resource is attached and {@link getRepository()} to
 * obtain the attached repository.
 *
 * You can create a reference to a resource by calling {@link createReference()}.
 * References can have different paths than the resource they are referencing.
 * Otherwise, they are identical to the referenced resource. Use
 * {@link isReference()} to check whether a resource is a reference. You can
 * call {@link getRepositoryPath()} to retrieve the path of the referenced
 * resource.
 *
 * If you implement a custom resource, let your test extend
 * {@link AbstractResourceTest} to make sure your resource satisfies the
 * constraints of the interface. Extend {@link GenericResource} if you want to
 * avoid reimplementing basic functionality.
 *
 * @since  1.0
